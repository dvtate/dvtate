### Interests
- Systems Programming: I've used C, C++, and Linux for a long time so my systems programming coursework has always been pretty fun and painless
- Programming Language Design: I've made at 6 programming languages and it's something I really enjoy doing. <span style="font-size: xx-small;">Theory is fun too</span>

### Work
I'm currently doing freelance on upwork while I finish my degree but 
- Hats I've worn: SWE, backend developer, full-stack developer, sysadmin, PM, consulting, etc.
- Industries: Fintech, CAE, Computer graphics, startups, etc.
